# t-mkv

My first C# project in many years and my first C#-GUI-project ever, so bear in mind that this project may include huge bugs, big "don't"s and many "WTF"-places.

t-mkv is (or will be) a tool for easier and faster processing of .mkv files in my personal archive and for the implementation of my own usage conventions (sort of a "style guide") of mkv elements.
